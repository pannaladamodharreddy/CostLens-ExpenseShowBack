CostLens for shared services cost showback

An ETL Data pipeline which processes the shared services (Public or Private (On Prem) Cloud services) Spend/Usage Data

Large shared services in any organization is growing and expensive and their allocation, calculation has different methods (Even/Split/Partition allocations etc) Allocating and calculating the spend v/s usage costs metric will provide a great transparency of how much individual teams within an organization or outside of the organization have been spent v/s how much actual their usage is.
Thus, we can hold teams accountable by sharing the cost showback and after proving and providing the transparency we can start charging back the teams who have been used the most number of metric units and what service is highly used across which product teams questions can be answered.
